## Technologies

The Poppins's Shoppings project is powered by **Flask** on the backend, with **React** and **Redux** rendering data on the frontend. <br /> 

**PostgreSQL** is the database medium where the data is stored, and **SQLAlchemy** is its backend interface; additionally, images that display the products are stored on **Amazon Web Services**, allowing for easy file uploading and deletion. <br />

Users are authenticated via **CSRF tokens** to ensure security while exploring the site.

## To run the site locally...
### Getting started

1. Clone this repository (main branch only).

2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment.

4. Make sure the SQLite3 database connection URL is in the **.env** file.

5. This starter organizes all tables inside the `flask_schema` schema, defined
   by the `SCHEMA` environment variable. Replace the value for
   `SCHEMA` with a unique name, **making sure you use the snake_case
   convention.**

6. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your
   Flask app:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

7. The React frontend has no styling applied. Copy the **.css** files from your
   Authenticate Me project into the corresponding locations in the
   **react-vite** folder to give your project a unique look.

8. To run the React frontend in development, `cd` into the **react-vite**
   directory and run `npm i` to install dependencies. Next, run `npm run build`
   to create the `dist` folder. The starter has modified the `npm run build`
   command to include the `--watch` flag. This flag will rebuild the **dist**
   folder whenever you change your code, keeping the production version up to
   date.

### Add environment variables

In the development environment, you have been securing your environment
variables in a **.env** file, which has been removed from source control (i.e.,
the file is git ignored). In this step, you will need to input the keys and
values for the environment variables you need for production into the Render
GUI.

Add the following keys and values in the Render GUI form:

- SECRET_KEY (click "Generate" to generate a secure secret for production)
- FLASK_ENV production
- FLASK_APP app
- SCHEMA (your unique schema name, in snake_case)

In a new tab, navigate to your dashboard and click on your Postgres database
instance.

Add the following keys and values:

- DATABASE_URL (copy value from the **External Database URL** field)

**Note:** Add any other keys and values that may be present in your local
**.env** file. As you work to develop your project further, you may need to add
more environment variables to your local **.env** file. Make sure you also add these
environment variables to the Render GUI for the next deployment.
